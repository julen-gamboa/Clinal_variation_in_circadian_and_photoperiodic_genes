H sapiens (PASS) all	18122156
H sapiens (circadian subset)	6095
H sapiens (positive control subset)	3464
H sapiens (dataset to partition and cluster) 18112597

1) Partition the data first and foremost. An 80:20 partition would yield 3,622,519 sequences on the test set and 14,490,078 sequences on the training set
2) Add the circadian subset to the test set
3) Keep the positive control subset separate from the test set
4) Cluster the remaining sequences (training set) with cd-hit at 100pc identity and coverage to reduce redundancy at the sequence level
5) Generate amino acid frequencies for resulting cd-hit cluster representative sequences
6) Normalize with IHS method (inverse hyperbolic sine)
(normalization of the training set must be independent of the testing set and positive control set)

This is now ready for downstream machine learning analyses
